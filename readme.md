# Posters-Express - a posters website

`express` `node js` `npm` `ejs` `heroku` `flexbox`

The aim of this project was to practice express and querying data in json format.
Design replicated from Junique.com. The final version is deployed on Heroku.

------

## Key elements in the project

* **A search bar** that returns posters based on exact match by comparing the queried `search` parameter to the values in the data in the data mapper.

* **A Filtering and Sort system** to sort posters and display those that match certain criteria (theme).
This was made by integrating a very cool js plugin (MixItUp 3). Functionalities and options are customized in the mixitup function.

    âœ” Users can sort posters by price or name.  

    âœ” Users can filter posters by theme and style.

  âœ” By default, all posters from the dataset are displayed.



* The total amount of posters on page is updated on page load.

* Poster images change when the user hovers on the image.

##### Possible project implementations in the near future:  

* A product page for each poster (route by product id)
* A page that lists teh user's favorite posters (cookies-session)
